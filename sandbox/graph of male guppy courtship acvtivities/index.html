	<h1>Force Directed Graph of Male Guppy Courtship Activities</h1>
	<p><i>Arian Prabowo</i></p>

<p>This page visualizes the graph of male guppy courtship activities as described in the figure 4 of the study by Baerends et al., 1995 using forced directed graphing (Kamada and Kawai, 1989). The internodal force is calculated using 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential (Jones, 1924). The table below contains the data from where the graph is based. To make the graph undirectional, the weights from both directions are added linearly.</p>
